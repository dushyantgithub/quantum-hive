# 🧠 Quantum Hive

**Quantum Hive** is an offline-capable, Jarvis-like AI assistant built on a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB). It uses local speech-to-text and text-to-speech systems, processes natural language using either local or API-based LLMs, and responds with a speaking avatar UI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 Offline speech-to-text using Vosk
- 💬 AI response from either OpenAI (cloud) or quantized LLM (local)
- 🗣️ Voice responses using eSpeak NG or Coqui TTS
- 👁️ Face-tracking avatar UI built with Electron + Three.js (in progress)
- 🌐 Raspberry Pi acts as an edge server, remotely accessible
- 🔌 Google Home integration planned for device control

### ✅ Next Steps

1. Do you want me to generate this folder with template `.py` files and a working `main.py` that ties STT → AI → TTS?
2. Would you like to start with **Vosk + eSpeak** for first testing?

Let me know if you'd like this as a downloadable ZIP or GitHub-ready format.
